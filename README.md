# walking-dead
- Command-line based zombie game

// In this game, you and a zombie will each be given a certain amount of health. (Perhaps: You 70, Zombie 15).

// For each round, you will be asked to guess a random number between 1 and 5.
// If your guess matches the random number of the Zombie -- you inflict a random amount of damage between 1 and 5.
// If you guess does not match the random number of the Zombie -- the Zombie inflicts a random amount of damage to you between 1 and 5.
// Each round the zombie is given a new random number and you must guess again.

// The game ends when you or the zombie gets to 0 health.
